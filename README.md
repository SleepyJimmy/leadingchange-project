# leadingchange-project
This project was created as part of the "Leading Change in Practice" module during my final year at university (Term 2, February 2023). The website is designed to promote awareness about how to live a healthier lifestyle, both physically and mentally.


## Project Overview 
The website serves as a digital aid for the module's project, providing an interactive platform to present key concepts, tools, and strategies for leading change toward a healthier lifestyle. It covers various aspects, including physical wellness, mental well-being, and practical tips for implementing positive lifestyle changes.


## Outcome
This project helped me develop my skills in web development, particularly in creating responsive and accessible designs. Additionally, it deepened my understanding of promoting a healthy lifestyle by allowing me to apply theoretical knowledge in a practical, interactive format.
